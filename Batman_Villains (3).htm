=== Organized Crime ===
{{Main|Gotham Organized Crime}}
The first villains the [[Batman]] ever had to fight in [[Gotham City]] were naturally the local organized crime syndicates, set in place long before himself. Gotham City is one of the most notorious cities in [[United States of America|America]] for both crime and corruption, and as such has some of the toughest and most relentless mobsters.

'''The Roman Empire'''
During the Batman's first several appearances, Gotham City was largely controlled by the [[Falcone]] crime family, a local mafia division with ties reaching far out into [[Chicago]] and [[New York]].
* '''[[Carmine Falcone|Carmine "The Roman" Falcone]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 404}}&lt;/ref> Carmine Falcone, nicknamed "The Roman" for his unparalleled dominating expansionism, was the unquestioned crime lord of Gotham for many years. He had virtually all of the city's politicians in his pocket, including chief of police [[Gillian B. Loeb (New Earth)|Gillian Loeb]], and was met with no competition until the Batman began thwarting his various endeavors. After the mysterious serial killer "[[Alberto Falcone (New Earth)|Holiday]]" began bumping off members of his organization, he was forced to hire some of the newly emerged ''Costumed Freaks'' in Gotham to help manage his problems, arguably making him responsible for their successful semi-coup of the Gotham Crime Landscape. Falcone was murdered by [[Harvey Dent (New Earth)|Harvey Dent]], shortly after he became [[Two-Face]]. Falcone had three children:
** '''[[Sofia Falcone|Sofia Gigante]]''': The daughter of mob boss Carmine Falcone, as well as the new leader of the Falcone crime family following his death. She was also the serial killer known as the Hangman who murdered police officers on holidays.
** '''[[Alberto Falcone]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman: The Long Halloween Vol 1 1}}&lt;/ref> The son of Carmine "The Roman" Falcone, Gotham City's untouchable crimelord, who became a serial killer known as Holiday.
** '''[[Mario Falcone]]''': Carmine's eldest son, deported to Italy for criminal activities. He was shot dead by Two-Face.
* '''[[Salvatore Maroni|Sal "The Boss" Maroni]]''':&lt;ref name=DC66>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 66}}&lt;/ref> Another of the most prominent mobsters in Gotham City at the time of the Falcones, who also worked for the Roman Empire, was Sal Maroni, the leader of the [[Maroni Crime Family]]. Maroni helped fund some of the earliest experiments of Dr. [[Hugo Strange]], and was responsible for the birth of [[Two-Face]] when he cast acid into the face of his prosecuting lawyer (alternatively [[Harvey Dent]] or [[Harvey Kent (Earth-Two)|Kent]]). He was killed by Alberto Falcone. Maroni had two sons, [[Pino Maroni (New Earth)|Pino]] and [[Umberto Maroni (New Earth)|Umberto]]. They were both killed on the Columbus day massacre.
&lt;br />'''Rupert Thorne'''&lt;br />
* '''[[Rupert Thorne|Boss Rupert Thorne]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance:{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 469}}&lt;/ref> Prominent head of one of Gotham City's top smuggling gangs. He is also the boss of "Matches" Malone, the criminal whose identity was taken over by Batman.
** '''[[Hamilton Hill|Mayor Hamilton Hill]]''': A corrupt politician who became mayor of Gotham City thanks to Rupert Thorne. He helped Thorne oppose Batman, notably by firing [[James Gordon|Commissioner James Gordon]]. He was removed from office and disappeared.
** '''[[Peter Pauling (New Earth)|Commissioner Peter Pauling]]''': Puppet commissioner instated by Mayor Hill, on the behest of Rupert Thorne. He was killed after Hugo Strange manipulated him into thinking Hill and Thorne wanted him dead.
&lt;br />'''Assorted'''&lt;br />
* '''[[Joe Chill]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 33}}&lt;/ref> Joe Chill was the low-level mobster who murdered [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Kane|Martha Wayne]] in a mugging and was first arrested the same night he murdered them, but has since become somewhat more of an entrepreneur. He was killed.
* '''[[Boss Zucco|Tony Zucco]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 38}}&lt;/ref> Tony Zucco is the mobster responsible for murdering Dick Grayson's parents when the owner of [[Haly's Circus]] refused to pay protection money. Zucco's second in command and closest friend was the head of the Skeevers Crime Family, [[Eddie Skeevers]] who assisted Zucco in his plot to kill the Graysons. He is deceased.
* '''[[Lew Moxon]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance:{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 235}}&lt;/ref> Lew Moxon is traditionally held as responsible for the deaths of the Waynes, having hired Joe Chill to do it and make it look like an accident. Post-Infinite Crisis however, Joe Chill seems to have acted alone.

=== Central rogues' gallery ===
* '''[[Joker|The Joker]]''':&lt;ref name=BM1>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 1}}&lt;/ref> The Joker is perhaps one of Batman's oldest and most dedicated foes. A sadistic clown bent on chaotic nihilism and grinning death, despite having no obvious powers, he has presented more of a challenge to Batman over the years than any number of those more powerful or well-trained than himself. He is responsible for, among other things, the murder of the second [[Robin]], [[Jason Todd]], and the paralyzing of the first [[Batgirl]], [[Barbara Gordon]], who he made into a paraplegic. He is determined to drive Batman insane.
* '''[[Riddler|The Riddler]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 140}}&lt;/ref> Edward Nigma is a criminal mastermind who delights in rivaling Batman intellectually and has a strange compulsion to challenge Batman by leaving clues to his crimes in the form of riddles and puzzles. Despite his obsession, the Riddler is an extremely intelligent foe and has proven himself a capable arch-enemy of Batman, once even manipulating his entire rogues gallery in a [[Batman: Hush|mass conspiracy]].
* '''[[Two-Face]]''':&lt;ref name=DC66/> Harvey Dent, formerly Gotham City's District Attorney and one of the Batman's closest friends and allies, who had half of his face horribly scarred in an acid attack that left him insane. He's completely obsessed with the number "2," duality, and fate. As such, all of the crimes that he commits revolve around the number "2." He carries a [[Two-Face's Coin|double-headed coin]] around with him that has one of the heads scarred, and he flips the coin before he makes any decisions involving a question of law and illegal activities; even when it would senselessly inconvenience him, sometimes surrendering when he otherwise could have escaped. Batman considers Harvey Dent's descent into madness to be one of his own greatest failures.
* '''[[Penguin|The Penguin]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 58}}&lt;/ref> Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot is a short, round man with a long pointed nose, who fancies himself a gentleman of crime. He is also an enemy to Batman's civilian identity, since he blames the Waynes for the fall of his family. He usually wears a tuxedo, top hat, and monocle, and carries any variety of umbrellas which have various hidden functions such as vehicles or weapons. He sometimes gives Batman information in exchange for shorter sentences and to eliminate rivals.
* '''[[Catwoman]]''':&lt;ref name=BM1/> Selina Kyle is one of Batman's most famous villains and love interests. She started as a criminal who wore a cat-themed costume and often operated as an expert burglar, but developed a love/hate relationship with Batman. For years, she skirted on the line between villain and antiheroine. However, over time she became more heroic and adopted the role of the guardian of Gotham City's crime-infested [[Gotham City East End|East End]], though she still comes into conflict with Batman on rare occasions. In recent years, Batman and Catwoman's romantic relationship has developed to the point that she is a trusted ally of his.
* '''[[Bane]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman: Vengeance of Bane Vol 1 1}}&lt;/ref> An escaped prisoner from [[Santa Prisca]], an island prison in South America, Bane has abnormal strength as a result of having had experiments with a derivative of the drug [[Venom]] performed on him. He is also one of Batman's most strategically gifted foes. He became known as "The Man Who Broke the Bat" when he broke Batman's spinal cord and put him into a coma. After he woke up, Bruce Wayne was forced to give up the Batman persona while he recuperated. More recently, Bane orchestrated a mass conspiracy that allowed him to take over Gotham.
* '''[[Hush]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 609}}&lt;/ref> Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Tommy Elliot blamed Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] for saving the life of his mother, who he hated and had tried to murder. Years later he resurfaced taking up the guise of "Hush," and coordinated a massive physical and psychological attack from many different fronts using the other members of Batman's rogues gallery as accomplices or pawns.
* '''[[Killer Croc]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 358}}&lt;/ref> Waylon Jones is a former crocodile wrestler turned criminal who was deformed by mutation into a humongous humanoid lizard. He has low intelligence but great strength, as well as crocodilian abilities, such as a keener sense of smell and the ability to hold his breath underwater for long periods of time. He is also a known cannibal.
* '''[[Poison Ivy]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 181}}&lt;/ref> Pamela Lillian Isley, a former student of advanced botanical biochemistry, employs plants of all varieties and their derivatives in her crimes, which are usually of an eco-terroristic variety. She possesses both the ability to control/manipulate all plant life and an immunity to all known poisons and toxins. She is often described as fanatical about defending plants from humans, even being willing to murder for her beliefs. She also has a love/hate relationship with Batman. In some instances she claims to love him, in other encounters she functions as an ally, and at other times she is more than willing to kill him.
* '''[[Scarecrow]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: ''[[World's Finest Vol 1 3|World's Finest Comics #3]]''&lt;/ref> Professor Jonathan Crane, an insane scientist and psychiatrist, specializes in the nature of fear. Dressed symbolically as a scarecrow, he employs special weapons, equipment and techniques designed to use fear to his advantage in his crimes. His most iconic item is his signature [[Scarecrow's Fear Toxin|Fear Gas]], which he uses to induce hallucinations in anyone exposed to it of what they fear most. His fear toxin has allowed him to be one of the closest to break Batman psychologically.
* '''[[Hugo Strange|Professor Hugo Strange]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 36}}&lt;/ref> First gaining fame as a psychiatrist who declared that he'd fully analyzed the Dark Knight from afar, Professor Hugo Strange lent credence to his own claims by deducing Batman's true identity as Bruce Wayne. However, his interest in the Batman turned into a deranged obsession, and he's used his medical expertise to hatch a series of bizarre plots based around genetics and mind control in order to defeat the Batman and possibly take his place. Strange's fragile mental state has left him with intermittent knowledge of Batman's true identity, a fact that hangs over Bruce Wayne's head - for if Strange ever snaps completely, Batman's greatest secret might be revealed. He is notable as Batman's first recurring major enemy.
* '''[[Black Mask|The Black Mask]]''':
** '''[[Roman Sionis]]''':&lt;ref>First Appearance: {{c|Batman Vol 1 386}}&lt;/ref> Following the suspicious death of his multi-millionaire parents in a fire, Roman Sionis inherited their fortune and then went on to bankrupt their company. Saved by a buyout by Bruce Wayne, Sionis came to resent and hate Wayne. Fixated on the concept of masks, Sionis carved one from his father's black coffin and sought revenge; his ensuing battle with the Dark Knight caused his mask to be burnt into his skin, remaking him as the Black Mask. Sionis is a feared gang leader and one of the most powerful mob bosses in Gotham, with a burning hatred for the Batman.
** '''[[Jeremiah Arkham]]''': Doctor Jeremiah Arkham was the somewhat sadistic administrator of [[Arkham Asylum]] who naively believed that the criminals he housed could one day be rehabilitated. After the death of Roman Sionis, he took up the mask of Black Mask. The new Black Mask quickly made a name for himself by blowing up Arkham Asylum and forcing Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Firefly and others to work for him.

=== Secret Identity ===
Over the years, knowledge of Batman's secret identity has been one of the most coveted and controversial desires of his rogues gallery. Many have tried, and a number have actually succeeded in discovering his secret identity. 
* [[Golden Age]], many two-bit crooks actually learned of Bruce Wayne. However, they were either tricked into thinking they made a mistake or were killed in a predictable manner. This included, along with others, both [[Joe Chill]] and [[Lew Moxon]], each of whom Batman revealed his identity to shortly before he intended to exact dire revenge. Joe Chill ran to tell his fellow thugs, but after he explained to them he was responsible for the Batman's creation, they murdered him for that; only realizing their folly once it was too late. Lew Moxon believed Bruce to be the ghost of Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] (who Moxon had murdered), and crazed, ran out into the middle of the street where he was hit by a truck.
* [[Ra's al Ghul]] deduced Batman's identity with almost no trouble. He had determined that whoever Batman was would make the perfect husband for his daughter, [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]], and embarked to find out for himself. Al Ghul simply figured out what equipment exactly would be required to live as Batman, and then deduced that Bruce Wayne was the only person on Earth regularly buying these. Ra's has used this information to make his attacks against Batman more personal, but does not fraternize with the regular villain community, and as such has never shared it. 
* During the events of "[[Batman: Strange Apparitions|Strange Apparitions]]," [[Hugo Strange]] was able to capture Batman through a complex feint scheme with an illegitimate hospital, and numerous trained venomous snakes. Although many other villains have undergone controversy in this situation, Hugo Strange simply removed his mask without hesitation, and then actually usurped his identity, and became Bruce Wayne himself. Strange also auctioned his identity on the black market, although he would later retract his offer; an act for which boss [[Rupert Thorne]] was believed to have killed him for. However, it was later revealed that Strange had simply faked his own death, as he often does.
* [[Bane]] was able to figure out Batman was Bruce Wayne in only a year.
* [[King Tut]] figured out Batman's identity at one point.
* [[Riddler|The Riddler]], seeking the answer to all of life's questions, yearned to learn Batman's secret identity perhaps more than any other villain. At one point when he was near death, he sunk himself into a [[Lazarus Pit]] to save his own life. In the ensuing bout of insanity, he simply realized Batman was Bruce Wayne. Later, he met [[Thomas Elliot]], the man who would become "[[Hush]]." As Elliot had a massive grudge on Bruce Wayne, and the means to act upon it, the Riddler confided in him, and the two worked together launching a multi-pronged attack on various aspects of Batman's psyche during the events of "[[Batman: Hush]]", utilizing many other villains as their pawns. Although Hush remains aware of Bruce Wayne's alter ego, the Riddler devastatingly realized upon Batman's telling him that he couldn't actually really use the information to his advantage, as "a riddle everybody knows the answer to is worthless", which he wouldn't be able to stand. Later, the Riddler would undergo mental trauma, and it is unclear whether or not he currently remembers at all.
* [[Catwoman]] has long been aware of Batman's identity, as she is no longer an enemy, but a functioning ally of his.
* [[Killer Croc]] could potentially figure out Batman's identity by recognizing his scent is similar to Bruce Wayne's. Fortunately, Croc has yet to encounter Batman's alter-ego.
* [[James Gordon, Jr.]] was able to figure out Batman's identity, due to the connection between his family and the Waynes.&lt;ref>{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 881}}&lt;/ref>
* [[Fleet Delmar (Prime Earth)|Karma]] is somehow aware of Batman's true identity.
* The [[Dark Knights (Dark Multiverse)|Dark Knights]] know Batman's identity since they are him.
* Perhaps most controversial with Batman's identity is the [[Joker]] himself. The Joker, despite numerous opportunities to uncover it for himself, has expressed numerous desires not to know who he really is. As if he feels it would sort of cheapen or ruin their unusual relationship, as Batman is the only other person he actually seems to consider real. Perhaps most notably, in "[[Batman Vol 1 251|The Joker's Five-Way Revenge]]," he has Batman unconscious and completely at his mercy, but elects to leave him alone as he feels it was only on a technicality, and he had always envisioned his victory against Batman as "''at the end of a bitter struggle''." The epilogue of [[Death of the Family]] reveals that the Joker is "incapable of even broaching the subject of Bruce Wayne". However, he later used his knowledge of Batman's secret identity to [[The Joker War|steal his fortune and go to war against him and his allies]].
